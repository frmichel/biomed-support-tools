This tool (cleanup-se-storm) is derived from tool cleanup-se and applicable to StoRM storage elements.

Tool cleanup-se applies to DPM and dCache SEs, using the GFAL API with GSIFTP access URLs. StoRM does not support GSIFTP as an access protocol, only SRM is available but it is very limited and does not allow long listing (limit to 2000 files by directory). 
Therefore, the clean up of a StoRM SE can be done only using the dump of files provided by an administrator.

This is based on the experience we had with SE stormfe1.pi.infn.it (Pisa-style dump) and storm-01.roma3.infn.it (Roma-style dump).
Before running, check the type of the dump you received, and make sure it is one of the 2 expected formats:

- The Pisa-style dump consits of one line per directory, the directory is relative to the physycal root and starts with "./", 
  then one line for each file within the dirtectory, like this:
     ./026a272d-5310-4d15-9d72-4f6b6231ea5d/persistent:
     -rw-rwx---+ 1 storm storm    232381 Mar  5 15:18 1425565082015_b8fad9d2-d36d
  CAUTION: the dump can be created with related paths or with absolute paths.
  Make sure that the paths are exactly like the example, i.e. relative starting with "./".

- The Roma-style dump with one line per file, like this:
     1889    Nov 15 2011      293a2edb-8c/tmp/132135307686717f186b3bc48.tar

Procedure:
----------

Inputs:
- SE dump provided by the admin in example/stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_se.txt
- LFC dump for that SE obtained with command:
  $VO_SUPPORT_TOOLS/SE/lfc-browse-se/LFCBrowseSE stormfe1.pi.infn.it --vo biomed --sfn | tee stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_lfc.txt

Make the diff between both dumps: 
- Pick up the SRM URL from VAPOR (https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vapor/vapor-voSupportingResources?vo=biomed) 
  in column "SRMv2 URL", e.g. "srm://stormfe1.pi.infn.it:8444/biomed".
- Run this command below to delete dark data files older than 6 months:
  ./diff-se-dump-lfc.sh --pisa-style \
                        --older-than 6 \
                        --se stormfe1.pi.infn.it \
                        --lfc-dump stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_lfc.txt \
                        --se-dump stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_se.txt \
                        --srm-url srm://stormfe1.pi.infn.it:8444/biomed

  This will produce several 3 files stormfe1.pi.infn.it.output_*.

- Then, delete dark data:
   ../cleanup-se/cleanup-dark-data.sh --vo biomed \
                                      --surls stormfe1.pi.infn.it.output_se_dark_data \
                                      --se stormfe1.pi.infn.it \
                                       | tee stormfe1.pi.infn.it_del_dark_data.log

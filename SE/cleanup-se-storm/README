This tool (cleanup-se-storm) is derived from tool cleanup-se and applicable to StoRM storage elements.

Tool cleanup-se applies to DPM and dCache SEs, using the GFAL API with GSIFTP access URLs.
StoRM does not support GSIFTP as an access protocol, only SRM is available but it is very limited and does not allow long listing (limit to 2000 files by directory).

=> As a result, the clean up of a StoRM SE can be done only using the dump of files provided by an administrator.

This is based on the experience we had with SE stormfe1.pi.infn.it.

Procedure:
----------

Inputs:
- SE dump provided by the admin in example/stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_se.txt
- LFC dump for that SE obtained with command:
  $VO_SUPPORT_TOOLS/SE/lfc-browse-se/LFCBrowseSE stormfe1.pi.infn.it --vo biomed --sfn | tee stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_lfc.txt

Make the diff between both dumps: 
- Pick up the SRM URL from VAPOR (https://operations-portal.egi.eu/vapor/vapor-voSupportingResources?vo=biomed) 
  in column "SRMv2 URL".
- Run this command:
  ./diff-se-dump-lfc.sh --se stormfe1.pi.infn.it \
                        --lfc-dump stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_lfc.txt \
                        --se-dump stormfe1.pi.infn.it_dump_se.txt \
                        --srm-url srm://stormfe1.pi.infn.it:8444/biomed

  This will produce several 3 files stormfe1.pi.infn.it.output_*.

Then, delete dark data:
   ../cleanup-se/cleanup-dark-data.sh --vo biomed \
                                      --surls stormfe1.pi.infn.it.output_se_dark_data \
                                      --se stormfe1.pi.infn.it \
                                       | tee stormfe1.pi.infn.it_del_dark_data.log

WARNING: in the diff-se-dump-lfc.sh, I've dectivated the check on file dates => any dark data file will be removed with no safeguard.

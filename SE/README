This directory provides a set of tools used to monitor or test Storage Elements.

- lfc-browse-se/
	Scan the LCG File Catalog looking for file replicas on a SE given by its hostname
- monitor-se/
	Reads the BDII to get the total and used space on all SEs supporting a VO.
	The result is in csv format, and is dedicated to be exploited further on by
	analisys scripts that will consolidate the data.
- show-se-space/
	Reports the total, used and free spacein all SEs supporting the VO. 
	The output can be in a human friendly format. Options allow to sort the SEs 
	by different criterion. This script is mostly used to produce results that can
	be displayed as is, as opposed to monitor-se that reports raw data.
- scan-se/

The tools in this directory help find out which computing elements support CVMFS for a given VO.
Here is a manual on how to use the set of scripts.

1. Run the launch.sh script: this will submit one job on each CE supporting the VO.
The job consists of test.sh and test_ce.jdl.
Output: job_ids.txt = IDs of jobs run

2. The day after, run retrieve_output.sh, this retrieves the output of all jobs
whom IDs are listed in _jobids.txt. When output is successful, file _jobids_ce_dir.txt 
is appended with job id, CE name and output directory.
Output: _jobids_ce_dir.txt
Output: job output in /tmp/jobOutput/...

3. Run listSites.sh: this analyzes job outputs and creates 4 files:
Output: vo_alice.txt, vo_atlas.txt, vo_biomed.txt, vo_mice.txt, vo_no_biomed.txt
vo_biomed.txt = list of sites that support biomed and CVMFS
vo_no_biomed.txt = list of sites that support biomed but not CVMFS

4. Run list_CEs_supporting_biomed_and_CVMFS.sh: this scrpt analyzed file vo_biomed.txt
and construct the list of CEs from sites that support biomed and provide CVMFS.
Output: list_CEs_supporting_biomed_and_CVMFS.txt

5. Finally, script tag_CEs.sh adds a tag to all CEs retrieved in the previous step by reading
file list_CEs_supporting_biomed_and_CVMFS.txt.
Output: tag_CEs.sh_failed.log = CEs that could not be tagged

This direcoty provides tools that help check what sites support CVMFS for biomed or not.
They must be used in the following order:

1. launch.sh
This script submits jobs to all CEs supporting biomed. The list of CEs is stored in _jobids.txt, and the list of job IDs is in _jobids.txt.

2. retrieve_output.sh
To be run the next day (enough time after submission so that jobs are all completed).
This script retrieves the output of all successful jobs in /tmp/jobOutput.
File _jobids_ce_dir.txt is built at the same time, it gathers the job IDs, the CE queue on which they were submitted, and the result directory starting with /tmp/jobOutput.

3. listSites.sh
Exploits the output of successful jobs to figure out which sites support CVMFS for which VOs: alice, atlas, mice, biomed.
Results are stored in files vo_<VO name>.txt.
Additionally, file vo_no_biomed.txt lists specifically those sites that support CVMFS for at least one VO but not for biomed.

Those files can be sorted by site name simply:
cat vo_no_biomed.txt | sort -k 2

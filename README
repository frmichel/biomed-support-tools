This project is a collection of utility tools to manage Virtual Organizations (VO) of the European Grid Initiavie (EGI).

It was initially developed by the Biomed VO support team (http://lsgc.org/en/Biomed), in particular to monitor the resources that support the VO. It is now maintained as part of the VAPOR project (https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/VT_VAPOR).
